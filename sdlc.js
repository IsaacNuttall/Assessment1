// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisofRequirements = "In this step, requirements are analyzed, and it is determined how they can be met in a way that best aligns with business goals and resources."
const Design = "In this step, the main elements of the project are designed and planned, including individual features such as architecture and security."
const Implementation = "In this step, the system design is translated into source code, and the first version of the project is built."
const TestingandIntegration = "In this step, the product is pushed into production by gradually phasing it into use, while ensuring that it has no bugs or exploits."
const Maintain = "In this step, the product is kept safe and at optimal performance, with the occasional addition of new features."
